## Motivation
- During our first year we were handed out the syllabus file for our course which was 129 pages long 
- Each cource has multiple specializations , faculties , resources , etc 
- It is very hard for a student to find the best resource and clarify their doubts in a standard manner
- For example, different notes for the same subject are given to students in different classes
- In order to help students find the best resource and clarify doubts , this webapp was created

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Future Prospects
- Create a point based system where users who answer doubts and bodt good resources get points based on the upvotes they get 
- Provide top contributers with additional benefits
- Allow nested replies to commments on various doubts and resources
- Add filter based search to segregate subjects based on department and year
